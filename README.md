# webpage-template
## What is this?

This is a template for making a [simple webpage] (https://jloan.github.io/webpage-template/) using HTML. This page can be published to the web or be run locally on your own and others computers using a web-browser.

## How-to use this template:

* You'll want to download this template. It will download as a ZIPPED file whereever your computer puts downloads. 
* Unzip the file by opening it. When unzipped your should have a folder named "webpage-template." I recommend making a copy of this folder and keeping a version of the original on hand in case you need it as a reference point. Rename this copy of you folder "yourname-webpage."
* To transform this template into your own webpage, open the "index.html" doument in a plain text editor. Without altering the HTML tags, replace the text for the headers (if you want use them), paragaphs, and other elements with your own content.
* You can test how your page is loking at any point by opening the index.html doc in a web browser (Safari, Chrome, Firefox, etc.).
* Add multiple pieces of media in your webpage. This could be an image, a video, an piece of audio. To add a piece of media, you'll want to use the embed code provided by the sites hosting the media (YouTube, Bandcamp, etc.). 
* If you want to add a piece of media that isn't emdedable from the web (like the picture of my kid playing drums -- which is a personal photo not available on the web), you'll need to put the media file in the "assets" folder and replace the file name in the <img src> tag wherever you are going to place the image. If you need help trouvleshooting this, let me know if you want to do this, and I can help with the HTML.
* Add a list of works cited as needed. No need to use an official format, just be sure to include relvant info about the work (author, title, publication date, etc.) and a hyperlink to the text if its available on the web. 
* Add a short bio for yourself at the foot of your text.
* If when you open your index.html file in a browser things seem broken or not to be working -- double-check that in the process of "cutting and pasting" pieces of content you having altered the HTML in a way that had made it not work. 
* You can arrange the elements of this webpage in whatever order you want by "cutting and pasting" the various sections into different places in the document. You'll just want to be careful not to change the HTML tags when doing so.
